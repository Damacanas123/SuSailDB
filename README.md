To get things running first you should have apache server(with preferably phpmyadmin) installed. And then first create a database named "susailordb" and then copy paste the code in susailordb.sql file to the sql in phpmyadmin.Then put the project directory in the localhost projects folder(in XAMMP it is htdocs under xampp folder) Then you start your local server and in browser type localhost/SusailDB/ and there you go.
